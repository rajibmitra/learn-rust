learn rust
1. Build your on wc - get started by learning to handle command line arguments and process file IO and text streams - https://lnkd.in/eCiv-RVA
2. Build your own compression tool - start digging into building data structures and algorithms using Rust to build a tool that compresses and decompresses files using Huffman compression - https://lnkd.in/e4WcUyYy
3. Build your own Redis Server - Building a clone of the original Redis server is a great challenge to learn either async (i.e. Tokio) or multi-threaded development in Rust. Alongside that you get to do some protocol handling, data structures and network programming - https://lnkd.in/eHRCAmCE
4. Build your own URL Shortener - a great challenge to learn about hashing and building REST APIs in Rust - https://lnkd.in/ezCc8EFR
5. Build your own diff - get into some dynamic programming with Rust - https://lnkd.in/e_AiKj3t
6. Build your own Shell - Rust is a system programming language so building your own Shell is a fun way of using it - https://lnkd.in/ewYjr5Yi
7. Build your own DNS Resolver - Some more low level network programming and packet handling - https://lnkd.in/eUB3nyxC
8. Build your own git client - build on your diff and add more data structures and algorithms - https://lnkd.in/eG6jYyRm
